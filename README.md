# FizzBuzz - Testing pytest

This is a test to see how pytest works and to practice the three methods of red-green-refactor cycle of TDD in agile development.

FizzBuzz is a function that takes numbers from 1 to 100 and outputs them as a string, but for multiples of 3, it returns Fizz instead of the number, and for multiples of 5, it returns Buzz. For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, it returns FizzBuzz.

## Requirements

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) to install [pytest](http://doc.pytest.org/en/latest/getting-started.html)

## Usage

```python

pytest -q fizzbuzz_test.py
```

Returns whether the fizzbuzz function in fizzbuzz.py passes the tests in fizzbuzz_test.py
